# Wheel of Fortuna Engine 

A Wheel of Fortune–style word game built with React, themed around Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science concepts.

This project focuses on structured component architecture and deterministic game logic rather than visual complexity.

## Tech Stack

- React (Functional Components)
- Vite
- Custom Hooks

## Features

- Deterministic wheel spin logic (result calculated before animation)
- Weighted wheel segments (points, BANKRUPT, LOSE TURN)
- 10-level progressive difficulty system
- 100 words per level
- AI & Computer Science themed dataset
- Multi-word phrase support (spaces visible, not guessable)
- Letter validation & duplicate prevention
- Vowel cost mechanic
- Score tracking & level progression
- Game reset functionality

## Architecture Highlights

- Clear separation of UI and game logic
- Dedicated game state management
- Modular component structure
- Deterministic state transitions
- Reusable UI components

## Purpose

This project was built to improve:

- React component structuring
- State ownership patterns
- Custom hook design
- Game logic modeling
- Clean folder organization

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
